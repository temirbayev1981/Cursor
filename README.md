## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS 4 |
| UI | shadcn/ui patterns, Framer Motion, Recharts |
| State | React Query, React Hook Form, Zod |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) |
| Payments | Stripe (architecture ready) |
| Maps | Google Maps API (integration ready) |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Verify release & production readiness
npm run verify:release
npm run verify:production

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) after configuring Supabase (see below).

**Current version:** 1.7.0 — see [RELEASE.md](./RELEASE.md) and [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and set **Supabase** credentials (required). Add Stripe, maps, and notification webhooks for full production features.

## Requirements

**Supabase is required.** Without `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, the app shows a configuration screen instead of loading data. E2E tests use an in-memory mock backend (`VITE_E2E_MOCK_BACKEND=true` during Playwright builds). See [DEPLOYMENT.md](./DEPLOYMENT.md) for production setup.
